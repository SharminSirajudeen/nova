# NOVA Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Storage Configuration Error
**Problem**: The storage_config.json had an invalid field `external_drive_path` 
**Fix**: Updated to use correct field names matching the StorageConfig dataclass

### 2. ✅ Model Recognition Issue  
**Problem**: NOVA couldn't recognize `dolphin3:latest` model
**Fix**: 
- Added `dolphin3` (without :latest) to model_info dictionary
- Improved model matching logic to handle version tags better

### 3. ✅ Terminal Spam ("Invalid argument")
**Problem**: Logging was outputting to both file and terminal causing spam
**Fix**: Removed StreamHandler from logging configuration to only log to file

### 4. ✅ Model Manager Path Issue
**Problem**: Model manager wasn't using the external storage path
**Fix**: Updated nova_core.py to read storage config and use correct models path

### 5. ✅ Environment Variable Issue
**Problem**: OLLAMA_MODELS env var wasn't set when running via 'nova' command
**Fix**: Added `os.environ['OLLAMA_MODELS']` to the nova executable

### 6. ✅ Better Error Handling
**Problem**: Unclear error messages when models not found
**Fix**: Added specific error handling for 404 status in Ollama API calls

## Storage Status:
- ✅ Models ARE correctly stored on external drive: `/Volumes/SandiskSSD/NOVA/ollama/models/`
- ✅ Current usage: 8.4GB (mostly from dolphin3 model and partial download)
- ✅ External drive has 869GB free space
- ✅ Main drive usage is normal (no 20GB mystery usage found)

## How to Run NOVA:
```bash
# Option 1: Direct command (now fixed with env var)
nova

# Option 2: Using run script (already had env var)
./run_nova.sh

# Option 3: Python module
OLLAMA_MODELS=/Volumes/SandiskSSD/NOVA/ollama/models python3 -m src.main
```

## Verified Working:
- ✅ Ollama API is running
- ✅ dolphin3:latest model is installed and accessible
- ✅ Storage config points to external drive
- ✅ No more terminal spam
- ✅ Model manager recognizes dolphin3

## Next Steps:
1. Run `nova` to test the interactive interface
2. The partial download in progress (deepseek-coder-v2:16b) can be cancelled if not needed
3. All future models will be stored on the external drive automatically
