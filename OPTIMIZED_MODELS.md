# NOVA Optimized Model Strategy

## 🎯 3-Model System for Maximum Efficiency

Instead of downloading 15+ different models (~300GB), NOVA uses just 3 powerful models (~49GB) to power all AI agents through intelligent role assignment and personality prompting.

## 📦 Core Models

### 1. **Universal Powerhouse** - `dolphin-mixtral:8x7b` (26GB)
**Roles:**
- 👔 CEO - Warren Buffett personality
- 💻 CTO - Steve Jobs personality  
- 📱 CPO - Product visionary
- 🏗️ Senior Architect - System design
- 🔬 AI Researcher - Innovation
- 📊 Product Manager - Strategy
- 💼 Business Analyst - Market analysis

**Best for:** Complex reasoning, strategic decisions, architecture

### 2. **Code Specialist** - `deepseek-coder:33b` (19GB)
**Roles:**
- 👨‍💻 Full-stack Developer
- ⚙️ Backend Engineer
- 🎨 Frontend Developer
- 📱 Mobile Developer
- 🔧 DevOps Engineer
- 🧪 QA Engineer
- ⚡ Performance Engineer

**Best for:** Coding, debugging, technical implementation

### 3. **Fast Creative** - `dolphin-mistral:7b` (4.1GB)
**Roles:**
- 🎨 UI Designer - Jony Ive personality
- 🖌️ UX Designer
- 🎯 Product Designer
- 📝 Technical Writer
- 🤝 Customer Success
- 👶 Junior Developer

**Best for:** Quick responses, creative tasks, design work

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Agent Selection**: Each agent is mapped to one of the 3 models based on their primary function
2. **Personality Prompting**: Instead of different models, we use targeted prompts to embody different personalities
3. **Task Routing**: Tasks are routed to the optimal model based on complexity and type
4. **Fallback Chain**: If one model fails, others can step in

## 💰 Benefits

| Metric | Traditional | Optimized |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Models | 15+ | 3 |
| Storage | ~300GB | ~49GB |
| Coverage | 100% | 100% |
| Cost | High | Low |
| Speed | Variable | Optimized |

## 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
# Run the optimized setup script
./setup_optimized_models.sh

# Or manually download:
ollama pull dolphin-mixtral:8x7b
ollama pull deepseek-coder:33b  
ollama pull dolphin-mistral:7b
```

## 🧠 Personality Modes

Personalities are achieved through prompting, not separate models:

- **Buffett Mode**: Analytical, value-focused, long-term (Universal model)
- **Jobs Mode**: Product perfection, user obsession (Universal model)
- **Linus Mode**: Technical excellence, efficiency (Code model)
- **Ive Mode**: Design beauty, minimalism (Creative model)
- **Musk Mode**: First principles, 10x thinking (Universal model)

## 📊 Task Routing

| Task Type | Primary Model | Fallback |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Architecture | Universal | Code → Creative |
| Coding | Code | Universal → Creative |
| Design | Creative | Universal → Code |
| Analysis | Universal | Creative → Code |
| Quick Tasks | Creative | Universal → Code |
